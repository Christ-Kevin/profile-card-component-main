### What I learned

In this project I mainly used calc values to make sure that my margins and body height are flexible and to avoid some items overflowing the body container. Another interesting thing I learned from this project is to use multiple background-colour properties in a selector and to distribute the different background-properties on the top, bottom, left or right side of the container. I even added the source that helped me in this sense among the usefull resources. 

I'm glad I used the following css

It allows you to centre an image or a container exactly at the centre of its closest parent
```css
  div:nth-of-type(2) {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

in-depth learning of the basics of flexbox and grid and application of the knowledge in the next project(s)

### Useful resources

- [CSS Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp#:~:text=CSS%20allows%20you%20to%20add,is%20closest%20to%20the%20viewer.) - This helped me for . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped centering image in his closest parent. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
